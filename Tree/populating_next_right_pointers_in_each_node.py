# What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?
# Note:
# You may only use constant extra space. For example, Given the following binary tree,
#          1
#        /  \
#       2    3
#      / \    \
#     4   5    7
# After calling your function, the tree should look like:
#          1 -> NULL
#        /  \
#       2 -> 3 -> NULL
#      / \    \
#     4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
